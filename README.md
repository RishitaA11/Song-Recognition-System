# Song-Recognition-System
It is a Python model for song recognition using audio fingerprinting. It extracts the unique acoustic features of a song and creates a fingerprint to compare against a database of pre-existing fingerprints.
It utilizes concepts of signal and audio processing using Fast Fourier Transforms to generate the spectrograph of the audio file and use spectrograph filtering to generate the unique audio fingerprints for the audio file.
